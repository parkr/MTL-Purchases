# A PHP Web App that allows me to view my Montreal purchases all in one place.

## Idea:

Make a very simple way to view, edit, add, delete, sort and search through MySQL data using PHP.

## To-Do: 

1. Create ability to count WHAT and WHY I'm buying these items. (data page)
	1. Total amount spent
	2. Average spent per week or per month
	3. Most-visited store
	4. Store that's profited the most from me (where I\'ve spent the most money)
	5. Graph of daily/weekly spending
2. Further refine "expected" page.
	- reformat table to get rid of some of that space
