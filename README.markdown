# A PHP Web App that allows me to view my Montreal purchases all in one place.

## Idea:

Make a very simple way to view, edit, add, delete, sort and search through MySQL data using PHP.

## To-Do: 

1. Fix search features
	a. Ability to specify what field
	b. Fix problem with spaces in query
2. Create ability to count WHAT and WHY I'm buying these items. (data page)
